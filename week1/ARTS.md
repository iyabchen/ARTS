## Algorithm

LRU cache
https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache

To understand it properly is not easy if you never read about lru before. Least recently used seemed straightforward, however, it is harder than I thought, even though read the solution before.
Even when draw, it looks complicated.
eg. capacity = 2, omitting the value, get the following
1>put 1=1: `1`
2>put 2=2: `2 1`
3>get 1: `1 2`
4>put 3=3 `1 3`
5>get 2, not found

The idea

- use linked list
- always put the recently used one(put or get) to the head of the list, so the tail of the list is always the least used
- use map/hashtable to store the location of the node (node pointer) in the linked list

The implementation

- get operation, if found, then move the found node to head
- put operation, if larger than capacity, then remove the last node, and add node to head
- because of the above, the linked list need operation including add(to head) and remove node

At first, I thought about using array to store instead of linked list, then the map stores the index of an item in the array. Since in Go, moving an item in the array can be easily done by re-slicing, which is creating a new memory for the array. But later found it awkward to index between the map and the array, because when it remove a node, it needs to remove by index in the array, but remove by key in the map, and all the map values need to be updated. Moreover, re-slicing is not the target of this problem.

```Go
type LRUCache struct {
    cache map[int]*Node
    head *Node
    tail *Node
    cur int
    capacity int

}

type Node struct{
    key int
    value int
    next *Node
    prev *Node
}

func (this *LRUCache) addNodeToHead(newNode *Node){
    if this.cur == 0 {
        this.head = newNode
        this.tail = newNode
    }else{
        newNode.prev = nil
        newNode.next = this.head
        this.head.prev = newNode
        this.head = newNode
    }
    this.cur++
}

// remove a node which is in the linked list
func (this *LRUCache) removeNode(node *Node){
    if this.cur <= 1{
        this.head = nil
        this.tail = nil
        this.cur = 0
        return
    }

    // cur >=2

    // if node is head
    if node.prev == nil{
        this.head = node.next
        this.head.prev = nil
    }else if node.next == nil{
        this.tail = node.prev
        this.tail.next = nil
    }else{
        node.prev.next = node.next
        node.next.prev = node.prev
    }
    this.cur--
}

func Constructor(capacity int) LRUCache {
    return LRUCache{
        cache:make(map[int]*Node),
        capacity:capacity,
    }
}


func (this *LRUCache) Get(key int) int {
    if node, ok:=this.cache[key]; ok{
        this.removeNode(node)
        this.addNodeToHead(node)
        return node.value
    }
    return -1

}


func (this *LRUCache) Put(key int, value int)  {
    ret:=this.Get(key)
    if ret!=-1{
        this.head.value = value
    }else{
        newNode:=&Node{
            key: key,
            value: value,
        }
        if this.cur < this.capacity{
            this.addNodeToHead(newNode)

        }else{
            // evict
            if this.tail!=nil{
                delete(this.cache, this.tail.key)
            }
            this.removeNode(this.tail)

            this.addNodeToHead(newNode)
        }
        this.cache[key] = newNode
    }


}


/**

## Review

[Hereâ€™s how I prepped for my interviews](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/software-engineering-interviews-744380f4f2af/)

Mostly, it is similar to the other interview articles, talks about the importance of algorithm and data structure. In all, it summarizes most of the aspects of an interview, and provides resources that one should study. How you should study the resources, it all depends on your background. I always see people sharing their algorithm solution, but seldom see how to analyze the problem, and find a pattern based on the past knowledge. For each type of algorithm, one can write at least 10 pages discussing all of its variation. In most of the problems, it requires a bit of tricks to convert a new problem into an old one, just like math questions. I guess only when you practice enough, then you build the connection in your brain for pattern recognition.

The points in this article

- Interviewing is a skill, so it can be practiced and learnt.
- Different types of interviews
  - algorithm
  - architecture design: ask the right questions to narrow down the requirements and constraints. eg. modularization, design patterns, scaling up API, decoupling
  - behavioral: be more genuine, admitting your weakness, and show initiatives for improvement
  - culture fit: lookup the company's values beforehand, find matching past experience that you can relate to the interviewer
  - pair programming - interviewer watching you program online: writing scrappy code and think loudly about what should be done in production.
  - finding/patching bugs - only seen once (really? feels like a quiz at school)
  - domain knowledge test - domain knowledge about a specific language's data structure, memory management, why an API is structured in a certain way
  - os questions.
- Preparation
  - write code by hand
  - deep knowledge of data structure: implementing data structures from scratch
  - understanding big O
  - grasp all major sorting algorithms

Note: some company has cooling period as long as 12 months, and once failing, it takes long to try again.

## Tips

FFMpeg basics

- container - Movie file itself is called a container, and the type of container determines where the information in the file goes. Examples of containers are AVI and Quicktime.
- stream - you have a bunch of streams; for example, you usually have an audio stream and a video stream. (A "stream" is just a fancy word for "a succession of data elements made available over time".)
- frame - The data elements in a stream are called frames.
- codec - Each stream is encoded by a different kind of codec. The codec defines how the actual data is COded and DECoded - hence the name CODEC. Examples of codecs are DivX and MP3. packet
- Packets - pieces of data that can contain bits of data that are decoded into raw frames that we can finally manipulate for our application. For our purposes, each packet contains complete frames, or multiple frames in the case of audio.

RTP supports many codec, but the video/audio codec definition is in a profile file(sdp file). To figure out what each of the sdp parameter means, the best way is to read/search in the [rfc doc](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566).

### My experience dealing with legacy code

I read about how to deal with legacy code before. Basically, the first and foremost thing to do is to insert unit tests wherever possible. However, the world is not ideal, and not every one understands the importance of that nor has the capacity to make it right.

In my recent work, I tried to port some codes to another platform. I am thinking it is a good chance to show some good practice. I used catch2 as test framework after a bit of research around. While refactoring the code, I tried adding test cases when possible.

Of course I still encounter many problems.

1. The test framework catch2 can only access the classes publicly. For private functions, you are pretty much tied. [Some argue that it is a design problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3676664/unit-testing-of-private-methods), saying if the private parts are complicated enough, it should be refactored to separate out. I do agree that it is a design problem. Since Golang does not have this public/protected/private definition, things are much simpler, and my mindset is still rooted for Golang. GTest supports `friend` class to address the issue, but switching test framework would again waste time.

2. Not dare to change the puzzling logic. The code has not much comments explaining why, and nobody around actually knows. If the intention of the code is mysterious, during refactor, whether to remove the part you don't understand always cost me lots of time to estimate. Eventually, I usually choose not to remove, but just copy the code over, and not sure how to test it.

3. I spotted some code smell. The old code mixed the data and the controlling logic together in the message queue. However, it uses that message queue to communicate with other apps which are legacy code too. You are not supposed to change the other apps, since they are gigantic and error prone, so at last, you have to make your code ugly, else much more work will be involved regarding re-design the message flow, and more untested code.

To fix the problems properly, it requires fully understand of the code and clear definition of the requirement. Again there is quality and time tradeoff. The more I understand the code, the more I find the feature might be useless and be thrown away in the future. In that case, spending this amount of time and effort, does it worth?
